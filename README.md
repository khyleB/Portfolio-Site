## Description
Since I needed a place to display my projects and commissioned work and also wanted to practice HTML, CSS & JavaScript I decided to make a portfolio webpage. The goal of this project was to create a website with a contact form, and dedicated pages for each project, while paying attention to simple design and bold spacing.

The website is hosted via GoDaddy and managed with the inbuilt cPanel functionality.
